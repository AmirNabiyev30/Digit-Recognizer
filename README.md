# Digit-Recognizer
The goal of this project is to implement a neural network using C++ from scratch to recongize digits from 0-9 using the public MNIST dataset. I emabrked on creating this project to learn the fundamentals of machine and deep learning and also improve my skills in C++. 

With this readme I am going to attempt to go into detail with the process of building the neural network. I hope this can serve as a guidleline for other people who try to do this project as I havent see many comphrensive guides online.

READING THE DATA

Using the MNIST dataset seems challenging at first and will require learnign extra bits of knowledge about binary and C++ in general.
